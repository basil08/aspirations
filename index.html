      <h2>What is Aspirations?</h2>
      <p>
        <i>Aspirations</i> is a product of a personal struggle to meaningfully define my identity as a young 
        responsible human. As I thought deeply about the socio-political issues that plague our society, 
        it became evident that there are few outlets that cater to the intellectual needs of a growing 
        body of young educated minds who are desperately struggling to define their identities just like me. 
        <i>Aspirations</i> aspire to kindle the thought processes that occupy the minds of the society, the future 
        leaders who wish to be informed and ask the right questions.
        <br />
        <br />
        In short, Aspirations represent the aspirations of this society.
